Various examples going through how to program assembly (x86_64 MASM).

How to get started:
  * Run generate.ps1 to generate visual studio project
  * Open generated project in /Assembly_Knowledge_Sharing in visual studio and try out the different examples :)

I recommend using Visual Studio 2019 together with the extension "AsmDude" (not supported for later visual studio versions). It's not required for compiling or running the code, but it does provide really good intellisense for MASM.
